Abstract: With the advanced development of information technology, there is a huge impact on various industries for the arrival of big data. In the biomedical field, innovative genome sequencing technology enables low-cost, high-throughput, and high-speed to become a reality, which leads to an explosive growth in data and also appeared in an urgent need to process those massive biological information. High performance computing(HPC)along with effective methods is one of the best ways to deal with the problem of big data in biomedical field which could serve the biomedical development best. We discussed the issues faced in biomedical big data processing and concluded that the bioinformatics is an indispensable component of biomedical technologies.
